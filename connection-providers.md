# Connection Providers
TuxJSQL uses something I call a connection provider to handle getting a connection.
A connection allows you to use different connection pools or different ways of connecting easily.

# Supported Connection Pools

|Connection Provider Name| Description | 
|--|--|
| Basic Connection | Basic uses just a single connection and is built in by default |
